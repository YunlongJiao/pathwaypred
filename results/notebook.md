## 160304 Meeting notes

- features are pathway-wise generated by hipathia -> goal: demonstrate its priority to individual genes
- compared to, e.g., mamaprint, we have interpretation on pathway level when predicting survival 
- other scenarios of prediction genres (drug effect, etc)

## 160307 15_Fey_Science paper notes

- first experimentally resolved network structure (JNK pathway) and then rule-based modelling using ODE
- use rule-based model to output biologically meaningful descriptors (the maximal amplitude (A), the activation threshold (K50), and the Hill exponent (H), etc) and set thresholds (Kaplan-Meier scanner) from training data and test the ability to stratify patients by KM statistics
- use of multivariate Cox regression analysis to establish the advantage of combining network components over individuals

## 160307 Questions to hipathia

- circuits encoded as 1) a pair of signal input node -> output with all intermediate connecting nodes and should they only be shortest paths?? Or 2) an individual effector protein as a signal output node and all possible paths leading to it??
- what about directed circles?? need to (and how) turn it to DAG first??
- how to go from the old way of evaluating p(union of A_k) to the new propagation algorithm??

## 160309 Meeting notes

- data are retrieved from ICGC regarding pan-cancer but only focus on BRCA for now
- compare gene expr features and pathway-wise features in terms of prediction
- data stored on server crom01/fsclinic/common/analisis/data/BRCA_saved_data/
- files description
    - fpgs$pathwayID contain pathway-specific info then $decomposedPathways for input-output-protein where IDs are indexed by KEGG; $effectorPathway encoded by one effector protein only; etc. Use igraph::plot() for illustration
    - genes.vals entrezIDexpr x patients (TCGA indexed); mini.genes.vals restrict to only genes used in calculating pathway features where missing values are always imputed by 0.5
    - hipathia contain four matrices, that are eff.vals effectorPathwayScores x patients; path.val decomposedPathway x patients; fun.val functions x patients where functions of effector proteins are encoded by UniProt taxonomy; go.val processes x patients where processes of effector proteins are encoded by GeneOncology taxonomy
    - clinical data include interesting phenotypes such as tumor vs normal; types of tumors; progressive stages; etc

## 160407 Meeting notes

- other types of labels to predict: binary survival status wrt threshold (or maybe survival time?), multi-class subtypes of cancer, etc
- see the prediction power of setdiff(all.genes, mini.genes) and how to combine this information in addition to pathway features?
- cross-platform or cross-technique validation in generalizable prediction efficiency

## 160412 Meeting notes jp 

- boxplots showing variance of performance over different algorithms do not make sense as it is too subjective to 'randomly' choose a predictor
- correct for multiple testing when comparing pairwisely feature performance

## 160426 Meeting notes with everyone

Three directions

- since we tested feature set y~A and feature set y~B individually why not test y~A+B together?? therefore we could pull all features together and learn a model on y~A+B+C+...+Z and do feature selection to see mostly from which set features survive?
- we derived pathway features based on mini-genes and lose interesting info from other-genes from the beginning so that we could do feature selection with pathways and add other-genes as predictors. by doing this we benefit from two-folds: interpretation with respect to pathways and identification of important other-genes that enhance prediction
- **learning of projection of pathway features onto "functionality" features instead of based on biological knowledge, leading to feature reduction due to meta-features

## TODO

- finish 6_fsPred.R where, for each fixed algorithm that does FS and prediction simultaneously, pathway features and other.genes are independently selected and then added together to enhance prediction??
- compare in 7_fsResults.Rmd by each fixed algorithm (mostly RF) to see if prediction is enhanced by this additional step? Then see using FS, compared to without FS but prname tuned out, if prediction is enhanced by FS?

## Future work

- [graph-based fused lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6409) for automatic detection of meta-features under GLM framework
- general: how to build predictors for highly-correlated features? how to use the network to guide prediction when features have strong correlation based on graphs?
- negative control experiments over: a) random network to generate pathway features; b) random functionality coding to exclude the potential of random projection of pathway features onto lower dimensionality
