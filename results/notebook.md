# Project CIPF

## 150304 Meeting notes

- features are pathway-wise generated by hipathia -> goal: demonstrate its priority to individual genes
- compared to, e.g., mamaprint, we have interpretation on pathway level when predicting survival 
- other scenarios of prediction genres (drug effect, etc)

## 150307 15_Fey_Science paper notes

- first experimentally resolved network structure (JNK pathway) and then rule-based modelling using ODE
- use rule-based model to output biologically meaningful descriptors (the maximal amplitude (A), the activation threshold (K50), and the Hill exponent (H), etc) and set thresholds (Kaplan-Meier scanner) from training data and test the ability to stratify patients by KM statistics
- use of multivariate Cox regression analysis to establish the advantage of combining network components over individuals

## 150307 Questions on hipathia

- circuits encoded as 1) a pair of signal input node -> output with all intermediate connecting nodes and should they only be shortest paths?? Or 2) an individual effector protein as a signal output node and all possible paths leading to it??
- what about directed circles?? need to (and how) turn it to DAG first??
- how to go from the old way of evaluating p(union of A_k) to the new propagation algorithm??

## 150309 Meeting notes

- data are retrieved from ICGC regarding pan-cancer but only focus on BRCA for now
- compare gene expr features and pathway-wise features in terms of prediction
- data stored on server crom01/fsclinic/common/analisis/data/BRCA_saved_data/
- files description
    - fpgs$pathwayID contain pathway-specific info then $decomposedPathways for input-output-protein where IDs are indexed by KEGG; $effectorPathway encoded by one effector protein only; etc. Use igraph::plot() for illustration
    - genes.vals entrezIDexpr x patients (TCGA indexed); mini.genes.vals restrict to only genes used in calculating pathway features where missing values are always imputed by 0.5
    - hipathia contain four matrices, that are eff.vals effectorPathwayScores x patients; path.val decomposedPathway x patients; fun.val functions x patients where functions of effector proteins are encoded by UniProt taxonomy; go.val processes x patients where processes of effector proteins are encoded by GeneOncology taxonomy
    - clinical data include interesting phenotypes such as tumor vs normal; types of tumors; progressive stages; etc

## TODO

- email jp about current situation and project proposal; description and dependency of current project; main project on wavelets along; jp can involve
- 160310 generate groups in processData and revise plotROCcv and finally send over to cluster for first results
