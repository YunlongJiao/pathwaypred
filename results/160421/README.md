# NOTE

1. Different from `../160310/` which only does binary classification, this folder makes multi-class classification!
2. Since we are dealing with multi-class problem, we always refer to the last level in the multiple classes as the `pos.label` when we compute measure such as TPR, FPR, AUROC, etc.
3. The codes in this repo is built upon codes from `../160310/` and `../../src/func.R` by the date of 160421.
